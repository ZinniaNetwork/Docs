# Premine



The Zinnia team has been active in the blockchain space for a long time and has witnessed the launch of many projects, both successful and unsuccessful. These projects have highlighted the necessity to have a clear strategy backed up by sufficient resources from the start to reach set goals. For this reason, we have decided to launch the project with a premine.

Zinnia launches with a DAO that governs all of these funds to create a fair network and equal opportunities for everyone in the community. Therefore, the community will have absolute control of the funds and not a centralized team. Furthermore, the premine was kept as small as possible to make the launch successful, and there were no free tokens awarded to anyone on the team.

The Zinnia blockchain launches with a premine that accounts for a total of 13.1% of the supply.  Of this percentage, 5% is airdropped to users of the Zinnia network, 5% is used to fund the initial launch of the project, 2% is available for providing exchange liquidity (DAO owned), 0.5% is available for a launch campaign and the remaining 0.6% is available to the team and advisors 24 months after launch.

**Please note that all information about the supply is subject to change since Zinnia is still in the pre-seed phase. Final figures will be determined together with early supporters and community members.**

Further details on the Airdrop will be announced in the coming months.
