# Issuance

Zinnia will run based on PoW consensus at launch. This means that new blocks are discovered by the PoW miners roughly every 30 seconds, and each new ZINN is created. During the first two years after launch, PoS will be introduced as a validation mechanism next to PoW, and a part of the rewards will go towards PoS validators.

The block reward starts at 70 $ZINN and will decrease every 10 years. In the table below, you can see the expected validator rewards being generated every 10 years.
