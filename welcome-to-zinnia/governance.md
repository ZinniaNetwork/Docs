# Governance

## Initial Governance

For eighteen months post-launch, governance will occur through Proof-of-Work mining (PoW) using the "Programmatic Proof-of-Work algorithm, otherwise known as Prog-Pow.

\
The Zinnia block reward for POW mining can be found on the following page:&#x20;

_**Note: Further details on mining Zinn are still to be announced.**_

## Future Governance

Eighteen months after launch, network governance will be changed to a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) / Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining system, enabling network participants an equal opportunity to vote on all proposals achieving a user-based governance system.&#x20;

_**Note: Further details on the hybrid POW/POS integration will be released in the coming months.**_
