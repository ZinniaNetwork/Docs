# Proof-of-Work Mining

## @ Launch

At launch (date to be announced) the Zinnia consensus mechanism will be solely proof-of-work and will use the ProgPow mining algorithm. ProgPow was specifically designed for GPU mining allowing everyone with a GPU to mine Zinn.&#x20;

## What Is Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Mining?

A GPU is a Graphics Processing Unit GPU. They are computer chips mounted with a fan and housed on the motherboard to render graphics.

Rendering graphics requires the GPU to process complicated math to display high-quality images.

Cryptocurrency mining also requires math to be calculated on large amounts of data.

GPUs offer perfect dual-use functionality and a passive income for computer and gaming enthusiasts who utilize their additional mining capabilities.
