# Inception

**Over a decade ago, a novel technology showed its face for the first time. Its name, Bitcoin, a payment system based on a combination of blockchain and cryptographic technology. Adopted as a store of value, a hedge to traditional finance, and a way to make money, Bitcoin surged, but for us, something had been missed. Could this complex technology allow a decentralized network of people to innovate with data in a way that couldn’t ever be changed?**

## We were captivated…

by this concept, and our team, individuals at this point, started their own journeys within the blockchain environment.

## We went to work…

on exchanges, assisted development, and marketed new cryptocurrency projects to assist the overall adoption of Bitcoin and digital currency.

## We began to theorize…

about new ways of providing legal proof, of revolutionizing the supply chain, of guaranteeing proof of ownership, and the possibilities seemed endless.

## We saw the potential…

in blockchain technology and how it could revolutionize countless industries.

## We started to dream…

of handing back control of data to the public and bringing truth, transparency, and trust to the crypto universe.

## And, we formed a team!

As blockchain technology explodes into public awareness and the media whip up a frenzy over cryptocurrencies, we remain undistracted by the hyperbole and focus on utility and equality instead of profit.

* We aim to become the one platform for everyone to secure and prove everything.
* We strive to create a network that bridges the gap from the cryptoverse to the real world.
* We believe we can provide access to the blockchain to every person on the planet, every day.
