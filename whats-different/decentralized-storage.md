# Decentralized Storage

## Everyone Likes Options... Right?&#x20;



Zinnia's DAO uses the community’s idle computing power and storage to build decentralized storage solutions for the world. Both enterprise & public storage solutions.&#x20;

The DAO’s goal is for businesses to interact with the network autonomously by entering into contracts without human contact.

Allocate Zinnia storage and get paid.
