# Understand the Future

**Usability and community inclusiveness are one of the biggest challenges in the adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications; that much is clear.**&#x20;

The industry is flourishing with incredibly original ideas and fantastic functionality however, the majority are shrouded in complexities. Financial, UI, and access complexities prevent decentralized technology from benefiting from the innovation that mass adoption will inevitably bring.&#x20;

## **Mass Adoption**

We want everybody to have equal access to our technology regardless of age, sex, income, race, employment, location, or education. This is why our core focus is to bring the best innovations in the industry to Zinnia and make them usable in the real-world so, as a family across generations and boundaries, we can all experience and shape the future together.
