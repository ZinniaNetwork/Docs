# Z-2122

**Until now, the long-term network health of most chains has been overlooked by developers, miners, and holders of layer 1 assets. Profit has been at the forefront of these chains, not the networkâ€™s longevity.**

On Zinnia Network, priority fees on the network go to Z-2122 rather than network validators.

## Z-2122 is a treasury controlled by the DAO.&#x20;

Its purpose is to substitute the minting of new coins post-2122 to ensure the longevity of the network and its health. Initially, Z-2122 will be locked for a period of 10yrs, after which the DAO will vote for the first time on its use or its relock.

## Example: Z-2122

#### Question:&#x20;

Does the DAO need additional funds for development?&#x20;

#### DAO votes YES:&#x20;

Required development funds are used and unused funds are re-locked for a further 10 years.

#### DAO votes NO:&#x20;

Z-2122 will be locked for a further 10 years.
