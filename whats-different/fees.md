# Fees

**Sending money across blockchains should NOT cost a fortune; fees should be minimal compared to the amount sent.**&#x20;

A frustrating problem with most smart contract enabled networks is that layer 1 transactions incur the same priority fees as layer 2 transactions.

We believe native transactions and payments not associated with layer 2 activity should always receive network priority. At launch and for the foreseeable future, fees will be minimal. While this is true for all new chains, Zinnia will not rest on its laurels like others.



&#x20;Fixed layer 1 fees based on a percentage of the total TX value is where we are going.
