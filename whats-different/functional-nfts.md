# Functional NFTs

**NFTs are in the foreground of the crypto industry. However, there are some key challenges that need to be addressed.**&#x20;

Centralized data storage paired with the perception that on-chain data is definitive, exposes the market to becoming a perfect environment for NFT fraud. Furthermore, the real-world practical use cases and access to decentralized marketplaces are key growth areas for NFTs.

## Proof of Creation&#x20;

Digital art is the cornerstone of the NFT space. What if you could prove more than the result? With Zinnia, you can track the progress of work through the Proof of Creation NFT protocol.&#x20;

More information on these tools will be released in the coming months.&#x20;

&#x20;

## Decentralized Marketplaces&#x20;

The Zinnia network will enable you to monetize NFTs in a fully decentralized way. The goal is to create a decentralized marketplace right inside the user app. In this marketplace, you can sell your digital art and transfer functional NFTs. Most importantly, it also offers the first big leap for the monetization of personal data NFTs.
