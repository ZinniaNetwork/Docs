# Block Explorers

**A block explorer allows the user to view transactions recorded on the blockchain. Simple, yes, buts let's take a deeper look.**

## Different Explorers&#x20;

There is a multitude of different block explorers, some are specific to a blockchain whereas others can be used across various networks. For example, a Bitcoin explorer can only view transactions on Bitcoin however a universal block explorer may be able to view transactions recorded on Bitcoin and various other blockchains.

## What Can you Find?&#x20;

So, we've established that a block explorer gives users the ability to view blockchain activity but what else can they do? The most common tasks are to find specific transactions or to get a general overview of activity on the chain but they can also be used to monitor pending transactions and user balances.

## Other Uses&#x20;

Block Explorers can also search the following;

* Wallet history&#x20;
* Orphaned Blocks&#x20;
* Double Spend Transactions&#x20;
* Genesis Block&#x20;
* Largest transaction
* Average transaction fees
* Hash rate
* Mining difficulty&#x20;
* Change Addresses

## Sounds like a Search Engine&#x20;

Well, that's because it is, a block explorer can basically be used to search for anything a user may wish to find out about a specific blockchain.
